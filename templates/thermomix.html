                My mother in law actually has the TM21 that was released in
                1996. She always sang the praises of the kitchen appliance. She
                is the one and I thank her for that, who suggested me to have a
                Thermomix.
                <br />Six months after I got my little one, I felt just
                overwhelmed by our new life with a baby, not finding the time to
                cook as before. <br />While I was trying to get on a new routine
                as a new mum, my passion for cooking just faded away, I had no
                interest anymore in cooking or in sharing meals with friends,
                <br />
                I had no inspiration anymore and if we were not ordering ready
                meals, the basic food I would prepare back then was not
                appealing and flat.
                <br />My priorities had changed and I needed to adjust myself to
                our new life. <br />I needed help to save time for myself, get
                to know my little baby, eat properly, make real healthy meals
                for the family, and get ready for when I will be back to my full
                time job! <br />It was enough to rely on the ready meals; it was
                time more than ever to take care of our bodies and mind. <br />I
                found excuses to jump as it is an investment and it took a while
                to decide myself buying Thermomix. Initially it “was too much
                money for a simple blender!!!” <br />
                Then “it will take away the joy of food prep and the love of my
                pots and pans”, it will take me away from the kitchen, which is
                my “escape” from the daily worries!
                <br />Out of the three reasons, the last two points were not
                valid anymore as the pots and pans I was praising used to stay
                in the cupboards and trying to organize our healthy and weekly
                meal was stressful and time consuming.

                Becoming a Thermomix advisor and being able to earn it or have
                it discounted was sorting out my doubt in putting that much
                money for a “simple blender”.
                <br />Not that we couldn’t afford it, it is the feeling that you
                don’t want to believe it really will help you. You are afraid to
                be disappointed. <br />
                The truth is that the minute an advisor came to my home for a
                demonstration, I knew for sure I had to have one.
                <br />The truth is that the minute I placed Thermomix in my
                kitchen and prepared my first bread and soup in my new kitchen
                assistant, I knew it was the best investment for my time, for
                our mind and body health. <br />The truth is that Thermomix is
                not a “simple blender”. <br />
                Thermomix is one fabulous and versatile cooking machine that can
                replace at least 12 separate other kitchen appliances. So it
                brought me to de -clutter my kitchen and make some space.
